#### Abstract
Use of Random Forest in Monte Carlo Risk Simulation 

Predictive models are generally tuned for achieving low biases and variances. Therefore, when the purpose of a model is to capture risks, i.e. volatility and variability in potential outcomes, predictive models fail to capture these more extreme events and are usually unfit to utilize as risk modeling methodologies. A Random Forest Model, however, can be used for risk assessment in Monte Carlo simulations. The aggregation of a few hundred trees moderate values too much. Each tree has too much variability. By using a certain number of trees in each Monte Carlo iteration, we can achieve both variability, volatility and non-linear dependences with other variables.
